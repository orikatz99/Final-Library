# Library - C++ ðŸ“š ðŸ“– Part 3
**This is the third part of my final project for the C++ course, completed at Afka College.**

**To the first part :**  [README.md](https://github.com/orikatz99/Taxi_Company-/blob/main/README.md)

**To the second part :**  [README.md](https://github.com/orikatz99/Library/blob/main/README.md)

In the third and final part of the project, we were required to make changes to the code from the second part  
(attached above).
- Implement a generic linked list using templates and use it once in the code.
- Replace all dynamically allocated char* fields in the class with string fields.
- Replace the use of arrays with the use of STL's list.
- Add an element to the story that incorporates the use of 3 **design patterns** (detailed in the attached report).
